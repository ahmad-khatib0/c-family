- Generalization describes the process of abstracting commonalities from a grouping of 
  classes and creating a more generalized class for that grouping to house the common 
  properties and behaviors. The more generalized class can be known as a base (or parent) class. 

- Specialization describes the process of deriving a new class from an existing, generalized
  base class, for the purpose of adding specific, distinguishable properties and behaviors
  to adequately represent the new class.

- If the derived class constructorâ€™s member initialization list does not specify which 
  base class constructor should be utilized, the default base class constructor will  be invoked.
